- IDOR: Insecure Direct Object Reference
- check for code encoding by trying to decode data (espcially try with base 64, commonly used). Then send back request with encoded data (like `{id: 10}`), to check if have access to ressource
	- can try using https://crackstation.net/ to decode
- can do the same with hashes
	- can use https://crackstation.net/ to try decrypt it
	- common algo: md5
- If not simple IDs used, can create two accounts and switch the IDs to check if IDOR is possible
- can also check for unreferenced parameters
	- ex: /user/details might accept used_id parameter, then can make request /user/details?user_id=123, to access user info
