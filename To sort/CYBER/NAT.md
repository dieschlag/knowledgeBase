- IPv4 addresses not enough for so many devices
- NAT: Network Address Translation
	- one public IP address for many private IP Addresses
		- need to actually reserve 2 public addresses
- routers must track ongoing connections
	- maintains a table to map internal IP address + port number with external IP/port
		- same public IP for all but different port forwarding
