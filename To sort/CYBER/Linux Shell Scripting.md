- .sh files, requires +x chmod
- execute via ./path/to/script
- beginning: "shebang": define interpreter
Ex: 
```shell-session
#!/bin/bash
```
- possibility to create variables: 
	- here: $name is the var, stored after read is called
```shell
# Defining the Interpreter 
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hey, whatâ€™s your name?"
read name
echo "Welcome, $name"
```
- loops:
```shell
# Defining the Interpreter 
#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..10};
do
echo $i
done
```
- conditional statements:
```shell
# Defining the Interpreter 
#!/bin/bash
echo "Please enter your name first:"
read name
if [ "$name" = "Stewart" ]; then
        echo "Welcome Stewart! Here is the secret: THM_Script"
else
        echo "Sorry! You are not authorized to access the secret."
fi
```
- comments can be added by using `#`

Ex:

```shell
# Defining the Interpreter 
#!/bin/bash 

# Defining the variables
username=""
companyname=""
pin=""

# Defining the loop
for i in {1..3}; do
# Defining the conditional statements
        if [ "$i" -eq 1 ]; then
                echo "Enter your Username:"
                read username
        elif [ "$i" -eq 2 ]; then
                echo "Enter your Company name:"
                read companyname
        else
                echo "Enter your PIN:"
                read pin
        fi
done

# Checking if the user entered the correct details
if [ "$username" = "John" ] && [ "$companyname" = "Tryhackme" ] && [ "$pin" = "7385" ]; then
        echo "Authentication Successful. You can now access your locker, John."
else
        echo "Authentication Denied!!"
fi
```
