- MBC: Malware Behavior Catalog
- catalog of malware objectives and behaviors
- support labelling and similarity analysis, standardized reporting 
- can link to ATT&CK methods, but not under same names, complements ATT&CK page, not just duplicate/reference => have to look at both
- Formats:
	- **OBJECTIVE**::**Behavior**::**Method**[**Identifier**]
		- ex: ANTI-STATIC ANALYSIS::Executable Code Obfuscation::Argument Obfuscation [B0032.020]
	- **OBJECTIVE**::**Behavior**::[**Identifier**]
		- COMMUNICATION::HTTP Communication:: [C0002]
- Objective: based on ATT&CK tactics in context of malware behavior, used to carachterize malware
	- ex: Anti-Behavioral Analysis: attemps to avoid detection by hindering analysis tools like debuggers
- Micro-objective: associated with micro-behaviors, action not necessarily malicious but serve various objectives
	- ex: PROCESS: behaviors related to processes (creating, etc.)
- MBC behaviors: defines behavior of MBC
	- ex: ANTI-BEHAVIORAL ANALSYS: checks if running in a virtual environment by exaiming various users and system artifacts
- Micro-behavior:
	- "low lever behaviors": actions not necessarily malicious but serve various objectives (like creation of TCP sockets, etc.), but does not mean it is harmless
	- ex: DATA: is able to encode data using base64
- Methods: tied to behaviors
	- ex: executable code obfuscation: simple number of string arguments to API calls
