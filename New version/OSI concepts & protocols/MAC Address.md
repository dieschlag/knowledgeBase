MAC stands for Media Access Control and is used as addresses for Ethernet and WiFi protocols.

A MAC address is a 48-bit number represented in hexadecimal notation, with a colon separating each two hexadecimal digits.

Ex: a4 : c3 : f0 : 85 : ac : 2d

The three left couple digits correspond to the vendor who built the network interface and the last three is the unique address of the network interface.
