SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol and defines how a mail client and a mail client communicates.

Some common commands used by this protocol are:
- HELO or EHLO: initiates a SMTP session
- MAIL FROM: specifies the sender's address
- RCPT TO: specifies the recipient's address
- DATA: indicates the client will start sending the data of the email
- `.`: is used on a single line by itself to indicate the end of an email message

The default port used by this protocol is the TCP port **25**.
