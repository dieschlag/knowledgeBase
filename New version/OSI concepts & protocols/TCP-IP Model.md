TCP/IP Model stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and was developed in the 1970s by the Departement of Defense (DoD). The strength of this model is that it allows a network to continue to function even though parts of it are out of service.

The model has similarities with the OSI model and layers of the OSI model are actually included inside the TCP/IP model.

The layers are the following:

- Application Layer: includes the layers 7, 6 and 5 of the OSI model
- Transport Layer: corresponds to layer 4
- Internet Layer: corresponds to layer 3
- Link Layer: corresponds to layer 2

Some textbooks picture the TCP/IP model as a 5-layer model, by including the Physical of the OSI model.
