- RSA: 2048, 3072, 4096-bit keys
- Diffie-Hellman: same size
	- for both, suggested a minimum of 2048
- Elliptic Curve
	- more secure, with 256-bit key => same security as 3072 RSA key
- public key: for encryption
- private key: for decryption
- Analogy of chest/lock/key
	- Secret Co(in chest): cipher
	- lock: public key
	- lock's key: private key
