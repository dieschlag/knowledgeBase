- Digital Forensics: investigate crime, establish facts
	- computer forensics
	- intellectual property theft
	- cyber espionage
	- possession of unauthorized content
		- File system: digital forensics image (low-level copy) of system storage
		- System Memory: access malicious program in memory (not saved on disk)
		- System logs
		- Network logs
	- Steps: 
		- Collection: identify devices from which data can be collected, ensure original data integrity, 
		- Examination: filter amount of data collected
		- Analysis: critical phase, analyze data, correlate it with other piece of evidence
		- reporting: detailed report, contains recommendations, presented to law enforcement, executive summaries so that everyone can understand
	- Methodologies:
		- Computer Forensics: most common device 
		- Mobile Forensics: extract call records, text messages, etc.
		- Network Forensics: investigation beyond individual devices, includes whole network, majority of evidence in network logs
		- Database forensics: checks for intrusions in databases and data modifications
		- Cloud forensics: little evidence on cloud infrastructures
		- Email forensics: most common communication method, emails investigate to check if phishing or fraudulent campaigns
	- Evidence Acquisition
		- Proper Authorization: evidence collected prior approval may be considered inadmissible in court
		- Chain of Custody: contains all details of evidence:
			- Description of the evidence (name, type).
			- Name of individuals who collected the evidence.
			- Date and time of evidence collection.
			- Storage location of each piece of evidence.
			- Access times and the individual record who accessed the evidence.
		- Use of write blockers: allows hard drive to really remain in the state it was, otherwise background tasks may change timestamps, compromising data
	- Windows Forensics:
		- Disk Image: all data on storage device, data non-volatile, always there after a restart
		- Memory Image: inside RAM, volatile
		- Tools
			- FTK Imager: to take disk images, can also analyse
			- Autopsy: open-source, extensive analysis of an image, includes keyboard search, deleted files, extension mismatch
			- Dumpit: create memory image
			- Volatility: open-source to analyze memory images, can support diff OS


- incident Response
	- Incident = true positives alerts
	- Incident Response carried out by CSIRT
		- CSIRT: Computer Security Incident Response Team
	- Types of incidents
		- Malware infections
		- Security Breaches: unauthorized person gets access to ressources
		- Data Leaks: steals confidential information
		- Insider Attacks: from within an organization
		- Denial of Service Attacks: flood systems with false requests, exhaust request handlers, data unavailable to legitimate users
	- SANS and NIST: organizations contributing to cyber security
	- Steps from SANS Incident Response Framework:
		- Preparation: develop incident response teams, proper incident response plan, deploy necessary security solutions to combat incidents
		- Identification: look for abnormal behavior, monitor abnormal events
		- Containment: minimize impact of incident, isolate victim, disable compromised user accounts
		- Eradication: removing threat, make environment clean
		- Recovery: recover affected systems from backup/rebuild them, tests 
		- Lessons Learned: document gaps between detection and analysis of the incident to help process in future
	- SANS ans NIST frameworks
		- for each process, document listing all procedures
		- Incident Reponse Plan: formal incident response document, validated by senior management and after incident has been completed
