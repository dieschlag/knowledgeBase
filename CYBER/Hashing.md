- Different from encryption
- no key and meant to be impossible, or computationally impossible, to go from output to input  
- [[MD5]]
- [[SHA-1]]
- [[SHA-2]]
- not secure if two files have same hash
- generally outuput is encoded after hashing, generally in hexa format
- Store passwords as hash, not as plaintext
- Hash Collision: two diff inputs give same output
	- consequence of the pigeonhole effect, if you have more elements than containers, some containers must contain more than one element
- Rainbow tables: Tables matching plaintext to hash output, used for password cracking
	- To prevent rainbow table attacks: use salt before hashing, random value added to beginning or end of password before hashing, one salt per user
- Hashing can be used for integrity checking, to check if hash of file downloaded matches expected file hash
- [[HMAC]]s
- Dictionnary Attack can be done with [[John The Ripper]]
