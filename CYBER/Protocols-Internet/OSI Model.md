- Application: programs
- Presentation: translates data for app (encryption, compression, etc.)
- Session: create connection between server and computer
	- can contain "checkpoint": if data lost, only need to send back from given point
	- unique: data can travel only through session separately
- Transport: TCP/UDP
	- TCP: Connection-based, ensure packet are all received , accuracy
	- UDP: send data without verification
	- TCP: segments
	- UDP: datagram
	- UDP: used in video/communication
- Network: locate destination of request, logical addressing via IP addresses
	- protocol to find the optimal path
		- includes OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) + RIP (Routing Protocol Information)
		- check reliability + connection speed (copper or fiber)
- Data Link: physical addressing, receives packet and distributes it to the right MAC
	- NIC (Network Interface Card), unique [[MAC Address]], set by manufacturer, burnt into the card but can be spoofed,
	- checks if received data hasn't been corrupted
- Physical: 
	- hardware level
	- electric signals in binary systemca
