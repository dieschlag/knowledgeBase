- Model to achieve integrity: 
- Constrained Data Item (CDI): data type whose integrity we want to preserve
- Unconstrained Data Item: all data types beyond CDI (user/system input)
- Transformation Procedures: programmed operations, read and write to maintain interity of CDI
- Integrity Verification Procedures: check and ensure validity of CDI
