Exemple:
1. Bob chooses two prime numbers: _p_ = 157 and _q_ = 199. He calculates _n_ = _p_ × _q_ = 31243.
2. With _ϕ_(_n_) = _n_ − _p_ − _q_ + 1 = 31243 − 157 − 199 + 1 = 30888, Bob selects _e_ = 163 such that _e_ is relatively prime to _ϕ_(_n_); moreover, he selects _d_ = 379, where _e_ × _d_ = 1 mod _ϕ_(_n_), i.e., _e_ × _d_ = 163 × 379 = 61777 and 61777 mod 30888 = 1. The public key is (_n_,_e_), i.e., (31243,163) and the private key is $(n,d), i.e., (31243,379).
3. Let’s say that the value they want to encrypt is _x_ = 13, then Alice would calculate and send _y_ = _x__e_ mod _n_ = 13163 mod 31243 = 16341.
4. Bob will decrypt the received value by calculating _x_ = _y__d_ mod _n_ = 16341379 mod 31243 = 13. This way, Bob recovers the value that Alice sent.
