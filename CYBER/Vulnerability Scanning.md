- organizations must regularly scan their systems for vuln
- goal: patch vuln
- Authenticated/Unauthenticated Scans
- Authenticated: 
	- requires host creds
	- can detect vuln once hacker has access to machine
	- deeper visibility
- Unauthenticated:
	- does not require host creds, only IP address
	- Identifies vuln that can be exploited by external attacker
	- less ressource-intensive
- Internal/External scans
- Tools:
	- Nessus: open-source
	- Qualys: subscription-based, continuous vuln scanning, compliance checks, asset management
	- Nexpose: subscription-based, gives vuln risk scores, compliance checks
	- OpenVAS: open-source, less extensive than paying versions
