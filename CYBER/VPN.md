- allows devices on separate network to securely communicate securely, creates dedicated path over Internet (**tunnel**), as if on same **private network**
- offers privacy (encryption to protect data) + anonimity
- technologies:
	- PPP: used by PPTP to allow authentification and encryption, use pricate/public key, need a match to connect, cannot leave the network by itself
	- PPTP: Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol: allows data from PPP to travel, supported by most devices, weakly encrypted 
	- IPSec: Internet Protocol Security: encrypt data using IP framework, strong encryption, supported by many devices
