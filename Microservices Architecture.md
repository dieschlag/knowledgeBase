With this architecture, as opposed to monolith architecture, the app is composed of loosely-coupled independent software processes, each with a specific purpose.

Each process is called a micro-service. They are able to communicate using an API (Application Programming Interface).

Advantages of this system:
- different services can be coded with different technologies
- each service can have its own database
- services can run on different machines, it enables an easy deployment of applications
- services can be scaled independently

This architecture is preferred when deploying in the cloud.
